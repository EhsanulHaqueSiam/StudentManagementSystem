# Student Management System

Welcome to the Student Management System project! This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for managing student information, course registration, and administration tasks. The system is built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and utilizes a MySQL database for data storage and retrieval.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

- MySQL Database: Install and set up a MySQL database on your machine. You can download the MySQL Community Server from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).

### Setting up the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/EhsanulHaqueSiam/student-management-system.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your Java IDE.

3. Configure the MySQL database connection:

   - Open the `src/main/resources/config.properties` file.
   - Modify the `db.url`, `db.username`, and `db.password` properties to match your MySQL database configuration.

4. Import the required libraries:

   - The project uses JDBC for database connectivity. Make sure the JDBC driver is included in your project's classpath. You can find the JDBC driver for MySQL on the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).
